### FEATURES NOT SUPPORTED

* **Snapshot/Restore**: this has never been fully implemented, thus is not supported until someone contributes this code

## Supported Amplifiers

See *[pyxantech](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/pyxantech)* for a full list of supported hardware.

* The [Monoprice MPR-SG6Z](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=10761) and [Dayton Audio DAX66](https://www.parts-express.com/dayton-audio-dax66-6-source-6-room-distributed-whole-house-audio-system-with-keypads-25-wpc--300-585) appear to have licensed or copied the serial interface from Xantech. Both Monoprice and Dayton Audio use a version of the Xantech multi-zone controller protocol.

* Some Xantech MX88 models only support RS232 control using the DB15 output on the rear. This requiries either Xantech's special DB15 to DB9 adapter cable (PN 05913665), or a custom built DB15 to DB9 cable using the pinouts (see [pyxantech for correct details on making this cable](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/pyxantech).

* This *MAY* work with Monoprice if you specific the `monoprice6` config type, but `pyxantech` has not been able to be tested with a physical amplifier.

## Installation

If you have trouble with installation and configuration, visit the [Monoprice Home Assistant community discussion](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/monoprice-whole-home-audio-controller-10761-success/19734/62). The developers are just volunteers from the community and do not provide any support, so it is best to ask the entire community for help or questions.

### Step 1: Install Custom Components

ake sure that [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) is installed and then add the "Integration" repository: `rsnodgrass/hass-xantech`.


### Step 2: Configuration

Configuration is similar to the monoprice component here: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/monoprice/

#### Example configuration.yaml:

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: xantech
    type: xantech8
    port: /dev/ttyUSB0
    zones:
      11:
        name: "Main Bedroom"
      12:
        name: "Living Room"
      13:
        name: "Kitchen"
    sources:
      1:
        name: "Sonos"
      5:
        name: "FireTV"
```


#### Remote IP232 (UNTESTED)

With Home Assistant it is rumored that if you are using a remote IP232 module instead of a
direct serial onnection that you can specify file paths as *socket://<host>:<port>* in the
port setting. **This has not been tested.**

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: xantech
    type: xantech8
    port: socket://192.168.1.10:888/
```
